# File Encryption/Decryption Tool

A simple Java-based file encryption and decryption tool using **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**. This tool allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt various types of files using a password-based encryption key. It supports a wide range of file types (e.g., text files, images, documents, videos, etc.), ensuring confidentiality and security of sensitive data.

## Features:
- **AES Encryption**: Encrypts files using AES with a password-derived key.
- **Decryption**: Decrypts encrypted files with the correct password to restore them to their original form.
- **File Management**: Supports encrypting and decrypting files of any type (text, images, videos, documents, etc.).
- **Secure Deletion**: Option to securely delete the original file after encryption/decryption to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Password-based Encryption**: Generates a secure AES key from a user-provided password.

## How It Works:
1. Choose between encrypting or decrypting a file.
2. Enter the file path and select the password for key generation.
3. The tool processes the file and either creates an encrypted `.enc` file or restores the original file upon decryption.
4. The original file can be securely deleted after encryption or decryption.

## Requirements:
- Java 8 or higher
- JDK installed (for compiling and running the program)

## Usage:
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac FileEncryption.java
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java FileEncryption
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to choose the file operation (Encrypt or Decrypt), provide the file path, and enter your password.

## Example:
- To **encrypt** a file: `file.txt` becomes `file.txt.enc`.
- To **decrypt** a file: `file.txt.enc` becomes `file.txt` (after entering the correct password).
